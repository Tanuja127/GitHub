# Python Project: Multiple Colour Detection in Real-Time using Pandas and OpenCV

# About the Python Project:
In this colour detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically detect the colour (Red , Blue and Green) in a livestream video content. 
We will use three main modules for this project. They are NumPy, Pandas and OpenCV. OpenCV is a highly optimized library with a focus on real-time applications.

# Accuracy: 
We can see that our model has an accuracy of 99.7% to detect the colours.

# Applications:
1) In self-driving car, to detect the traffic signals.
2) Multiple colour detection is used in some industrial robots, to performing pick-and-place task in separating different coloured objects.

# Python Libraries Used:
[1) NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)
2) OpenCV
